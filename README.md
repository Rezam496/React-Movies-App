# Getting Started with vite

This project was bootstrapped with [vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5174](http://localhost:5174) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run test`

Runs the test suite in the development mode.  
The interactive watch mode ensures that tests are re-run automatically whenever files are updated.  
Check the Vitest documentation for more information on configuring tests: [https://vitest.dev](https://vitest.dev).

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production and outputs it to the `dist` folder.  
It optimizes the app for the best performance by bundling and minifying the code.  

The output is ready for deployment to any static hosting service.  
Check the Vite documentation for more details on deployment: [https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html).

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Code Splitting

Vite automatically optimizes and splits your code for better performance.  
Check out the [Vite documentation on build optimization](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html) for details.

### Analyzing the Bundle Size

You can analyze your production build bundle size using tools like [rollup-plugin-visualizer](https://github.com/btd/rollup-plugin-visualizer).  
Learn more in [Vite's guide to optimizing bundles](https://vitejs.dev/guide/optimizing.html).

### Progressive Web App (PWA)

If you want to make your app a Progressive Web App, you can use the official [Vite PWA plugin](https://vite-plugin-pwa.netlify.app/).

### Advanced Configuration

Vite allows you to fully customize its configuration.  
Refer to the [Vite configuration guide](https://vitejs.dev/config/) for details.
