# Getting Started with vite

This project was bootstrapped with [vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5174](http://localhost:5174) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run test`

Runs the test suite in the development mode.  
The interactive watch mode ensures that tests are re-run automatically whenever files are updated.  
Check the Vitest documentation for more information on configuring tests: [https://vitest.dev](https://vitest.dev).

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production and outputs it to the `dist` folder.  
It optimizes the app for the best performance by bundling and minifying the code.  

The output is ready for deployment to any static hosting service.  
Check the Vite documentation for more details on deployment: [https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html).
